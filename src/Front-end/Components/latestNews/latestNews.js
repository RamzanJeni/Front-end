                                            <Card.Body>Computer Science is a rapidly growing field that develops essential knowledge and skills for todayâ€™s world. Between 2008 and 2018 there will be 2.4 million job openings for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) workers and by 2018, 51% of all STEM jobs will be dominated by computer occupations. STEM majors make substantially more over their lifetimes than non-STEM majors, by about $300,000 ($2.1 million versus $2.4 million). Computer Science also cultivates computational thinking, problem solving skills and creative thinking; foundational learning for all occupations.

                                            <Card.Body>Women and students of color are underrepresented in Computer Science. In 2010, although there were about 14% Latinas/os in the U.S. only 5.6% were in the Science and Engineering Fields (this includes Computer Science). While African Americans were almost 12% of the population they were 4.6% of the Science and Engineering workforce. Further, in 2010, women constituted only 28% of workers in these occupations, even though they accounted for nearly half of the college-educated workforce. Additionally, only 18% of Computer Science majors in college are women (Sax, 2015). To achieve equity in Computer Science we need greater numbers of women and underrepresented students, such as Latinas/os and African-Americans, in Computer Science. The diversity in the U.S. population should be reflected in Computer Science.</Card.Body>
